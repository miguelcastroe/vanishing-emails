# Vanishing Emails | Miguel Castro

**Vanishing Emails** is a tongue-in-cheek tool with a serious impact. Designed to automatically detect and delete expired promotional emails, it reduces the carbon footprint caused by storing unnecessary data in cloud servers.

This project was conceptualized and directed by **Miguel Castro**, Cannes Lions Grand Prix winner in Innovation. It blends environmental ethics with automation, rethinking digital waste through an infrastructural lens.
